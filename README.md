# Traffic-Risk-Prediction---Big-Data-Architecture
This repository contains the implementation of a Big Data architecture designed to predict traffic risks in real-time using technologies such as Hadoop, Kafka, Spark, Spark Streaming, PostgreSQL, Streamlit, and Grafana. The project processes mobility data to forecast traffic conditions, leveraging machine learning models trained with Spark MLlib.
